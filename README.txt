************* Aerie Lite *****************
******************************************

A version of Aerie for Moodle 2.3 and
newer.

=========================================

Aerie Lite is a fluid-width, three-column
theme for Moodle 2.3 and newer.

The custom menu contains a Home link which
always appears to the very left, and a My
courses and Login/Logout link, which appears
after any administrator-added items.

Aerie Lite has a settings page that lets you
modify various background colours, custom
footer, custom css, and the site logo.

NB: While the theme is for Moodle 2.3 and
newer, the version.php lets this theme be
installed in Moodle 2.0 onwards. Theme has
not been tested in 2.0 or 2.1, so using in
these versions is currently at your own
risk.

*************** Installing ***************
If you have downloaded this from Moodle.org,
simply unzip the file and copy the "aerie"
folder to your Moodle theme directory.

If you have downloaded this from github,
unzip the file, rename the
"kihitara-moodle-theme_aerie-NUMBERS"
folder to "aerie_lite", then copy that
folder to your Moodle theme directory.
